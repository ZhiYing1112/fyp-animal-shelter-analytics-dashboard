# Create function to clean the data
# Once the data is cleaned, show the data in a table.

# 3.
# Create a function to import the scaler and model.joblib files and make predictions on animal adoption.

# 4.
# Then create multiple functions to calculate each of the metrics
# Use the calculated field to plot the graphs using plotly and streamlit functions and elements
